# DataEncryptionInJava
This repository is about the data encryption algorithms that I implemented in Java with its Swing GUI.
There are 4 Eclipse project listed bellow:
- symmetricEncryption--Including traditional sysmmetric encryption algorithms(Caesar, Playfair, Hill, Vigenere)
- DES with 5 modes--Including the DES algorithm implemented in 5 specific mode(ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB)
- myRSA--Including the RSA algorithm implemented in my way
- mySHA--Including the SHA-512 algorithm implementation

All those 4 projects are actually the homework of the course 'Cryptography and Network Security' that I took in Junior, Undergraduate.
And the algorithms that I implemented in Java are all based on those described in <Cryptography and Network Security>--Principles and Practice, 5th Edition, authored by William Stallings.
